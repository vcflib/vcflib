.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]vcffixup\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Generates a VCF stream where AC and NS have been generated for each
record using sample genotypes
.SH OPTIONS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]




Count the allele frequencies across alleles present in each record in the VCF file. (Similar to vcftools --freq.)

Uses genotypes from the VCF file to correct AC (alternate allele count), AF
(alternate allele frequency), NS (number of called), in the VCF records.  For
example:

    % vcfkeepsamples file.vcf NA12878 | **vcffixup** - | vcffilter -f \[dq]AC > 0\[dq]

Would downsample file.vcf to only NA12878, removing sites for which the sample
was not called as polymorphic.

Type: transformation
