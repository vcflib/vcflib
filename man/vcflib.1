.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
vcflib contains tools and libraries for dealing with the Variant Call
Format (VCF) which is a flat-file, tab-delimited textual format intended
to describe reference-indexed variations between individuals.
.PP
VCF provides a common interchange format for the description of
variation in individuals and populations of samples, and has become the
defacto standard reporting format for a wide array of genomic variant
detectors.
.PP
vcflib provides methods to manipulate and interpret sequence variation
as it can be described by VCF.
It is both:
.IP \[bu] 2
an API for parsing and operating on records of genomic variation as it
can be described by the VCF format,
.IP \[bu] 2
and a collection of command-line utilities for executing complex
manipulations on VCF files.
.PP
The API itself provides a quick and extremely permissive method to read
and write VCF files.
Extensions and applications of the library provided in the included
utilities (*.cpp) comprise the vast bulk of the library\[cq]s utility
for most users.
