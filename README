vcflib
 a simple C++ library for parsing and manipulating VCF files.

author: Erik Garrison <erik.garrison@bc.edu>

The Variant Call Format (VCF) is a flat-file, tab-delimited textual format
intended to concisely describe reference-indexed variations between
individuals.  The current specification can be found on the 1000 Genomes wiki
(http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/doku.php?id=1000_genomes:analysis:vcf4.0).

This library provides a simple API to map each VCF record into a C++ class.
See included applications for example usage.

note: vcflib includes submodules, so to obtain vcflib you have to use:

  % git clone --recursive <repo>
