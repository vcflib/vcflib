The Variant Call Format (VCF) is a flat-file, tab-delimited textual format
intended to concisely describe reference-indexed variations between
individuals.  The current specification can be found on the 1000 Genomes wiki
(http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-variant-call-format-version-41)

This library provides a simple API to map each VCF record into a C++ class.
See included applications for example usage.

note: vcflib includes submodules, so to obtain vcflib you have to use:

  % git clone --recursive git://github.com/ekg/vcflib.git

or

  % git clone --recursive https://github.com/ekg/vcflib.git

To build, use Make:

  % cd vcflib
  % cmake .
  % make

Executables are built into the root directory of the repository.
